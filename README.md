   - `Training data`: Upload the `finetuning_data_cot_v8.jsonl` file.
   - `Suffix`: NotionGPT (or any other name you prefer)
4. Click `Create` and wait for the model to finish training.
5. Once the model is trained, copy the model name and save it for later. (It should look something like `ft:gpt-3.5-turbo-0125:personal:notiongpt:<ID>`)
